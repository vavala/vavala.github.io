abstract = {Outsourcing services to third-party providers comes with a high security cost, to fully trust the providers. Using trusted hardware can help, but current trusted execution environments do not adequately support services that process very large scale datasets. We present LAST-GT, a system that bridges this gap by supporting the execution of self-contained services over a large state, with a small and generic trusted computing base (TCB). LAST-GT uses widely deployed trusted hardware to guarantee integrity and verifiability of the execution on a remote platform, and it securely supplies data to the service through simple techniques based on virtual memory. As a result, LAST-GT is general and applicable to many scenarios such as computational genomics and databases, as we show in our experimental evaluation based on an implementation of LAST-GT on a secure hypervisor. We also describe a possible implementation on Intel SGX.},

abstract = {We show how to leverage trusted computing technology to design an efficient fully-passive replicated system tolerant to arbitrary failures. The system dramatically reduces the complexity of a fault-tolerant service, in terms of protocols, messages, data processing and non-deterministic operations. Our replication protocol enables the execution of a single protected service, replicating only its state, while allowing the backup replicas to check the correctness of the results. We implemented our protocol on Trusted Computing (TC) technology and compared it with two recent replication systems.}

year = {2016},
abstract = {Code identity is a fundamental concept for authenticated operations in Trusted Computing. In today's approach, the overhead of assigning an identity to a protected service increases linearly with the service code size. In addition, service code size continues to grow to accommodate richer services. This trend negatively impacts either the security or the efficiency of current protocols for trusted executions.
We present an execution protocol that breaks the dependency between the code size of the service and the identification overhead, without affecting security, and that works on different trusted components. This is achieved by computing an identity for each of the code modules that are actually executed, and then building a robust chain of trust that links them together for efficient verification. We implemented and applied our protocol to a widely-deployed database engine, improving query-processing time up to 2? compared to the monolithic execution of the engine.}

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of local balancing in multi-hop wireless networks. We introduce the notion of proactive routing: After a short pre-processing phase in which nodes build their routing tables by exchanging messages with neighbors, we require that nodes decide the relay of each message without any further interaction with other nodes. Besides delivering very low communication overhead, proactive routing protocols are robust against some well known active attacks to network routing. In this framework, we develop a proactive routing protocol that is able to balance the local load. Experiments show that our protocol improves network lifetime up to 98% and that it delivers a network that is more robust against attacks that have the goal of getting control over a large part of the network traffic.}

abstract = {Randomized Byzantine Consensus can be an interesting building block in the implementation of asynchronous distributed systems. Despite its exponential worst-case complexity, which would make it less appealing in practice, a few experimental works have argued quite the opposite. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we analyze a well-known state-of-the-art algorithm in normal system conditions, in which crash failures may occur but no malicious attacks, proving that it is fast on average. We then leverage our analysis to improve its best-case complexity from three to two phases, by reducing the communication operations through speculative executions. Our findings are confirmed through an experimental validation.}

It clusters users based on two types of features: account activity features and stream content (word) features and compares the usefulness of these different types of features in categorizing users according to their influence and leadership potential in the network. Results of clustering using different sets of features are examined to answer questions about distribution of Twitter users from the influence perspective. These results are compared against distributions of personality traits obtained from previous research on personality types and established assessment tools that measure leadership aptitude and style. Experiments with different clustering algorithms are described and their performance and cluster outputs are reported.}

  abstract = {We present Private Data Objects (PDOs), a technology that enables mutually untrusted parties to run smart contracts over private data. PDOs result from the integration of a distributed ledger and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX). In particular, contracts run off-ledger in secure enclaves using Intel SGX, which preserves data confidentiality, execution integrity and enforces data access policies (as opposed to raw data access). A distributed ledger verifies and records transactions produced by PDOs, in order to provide a single authoritative instance of such objects. This allows contracting parties to retrieve and check data related to contract and enclave instances, as well as to serialize and commit contract state updates. The design and the development of PDOs is an ongoing research effort, and open source code is available and hosted by Hyperledger Labs.}

Recently, how- ever, improving hardware and an interest in complex packet processing has prompted the networking community to explore software routers; though they are more flexible and easier to program, achieving forwarding rates com- parable to hardware routers is challenging. Given the highly parallel nature of packet processing, a GPU-based router architecture is an inviting option (and one which the community has begun to explore). In this project, we explore the pitfalls and payoffs of implement- ing a GPU-based software router.}

year = {2019},
abstract = {Consensus mechanisms used by popular distributed ledgers are highly scalable but notoriously inefficient. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols are efficient but far less scalable. Speculative BFT protocols such as Zyzzyva and Zyzzyva5 are efficient and scalable but require a trade-off: Zyzzyva requires only 3f + 1 replicas to tolerate f faults, but even a single slow replica will make Zyzzyva fall back to more expensive non-speculative operation. Zyzzyva5 does not require a non- speculative fallback, but requires 5f + 1 replicas in order to tolerate f faults. BFT variants using hardware-assisted trusted components can tolerate a greater proportion of faults, but require that every replica have this hardware.
We present SACZyzzyva, addressing these concerns: resilience to slow replicas and requiring only 3f + 1 replicas, with only one replica needing an active monotonic counter at any given time.
We experimentally evaluate our protocols, demonstrating low latency and high scalability. We prove that SACZyzzyva is optimally robust and that trusted components cannot increase fault tolerance unless they are present in greater than two-thirds of replicas.}
